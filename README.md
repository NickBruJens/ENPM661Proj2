# Dijkstra - Project 2, ENPM661.
 
The project was created towards completion of Project 2 as part of ENPM661- Planning for Autonomous Robots at University of Maryland, College park

The obstacles were defined as per shown in the problem statement. 

The Project contains 2 files
* Dijkstra_point.py
* Dijkstra_rigid.py

## Dependencies to run the code. 


* Python Version 3
* Ubuntu 16.04 (might work on future version, not tested)
* OpenCV Version > 3.4.4

### Run the code. 

```
* Clone the repository
* python3 Dijkstra_point.py # for point robot
* python3 Dijkstra_rigid.py # for rigid robot
```

### Notes
Average Run time for Point robot: 
Average Run time for Rigid robot:
